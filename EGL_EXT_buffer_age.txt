    Requires EGL 1.4

    This extension is written against the wording of the EGL 1.4 
    Specification.

Overview

    The aim of this extension is to expose enough information to
    applications about how the driver manages the set of front and
    back buffers associated with a given surface to allow applications
    to re-use the contents of old frames and minimize how much must be
    redrawn for the next frame.

    There are lots of different ways for a driver to manage these
    buffers, from double buffering, different styles of triple
    buffering and even n-buffering or simply single buffer rendering.
    We also need to consider that power management events or memory
    pressure events might also result in some of the buffers not
    currently in-use being freed.
   
    This extension lets you query the age of the back buffer contents
    for an EGL surface as the number of frames elapsed since the
    contents were originally defined. The back buffer can either be
    reported as invalid (has an age of 0) or it may be reported to
    contain the contents from n frames prior to this new frame.

    Once the age has been queried then it can be assumed to remain
    unchanged until the end of that frame.

    For many use-cases this extension can provide an efficient
    alternative to using the EGL_BUFFER_PRESERVED swap behaviour. The
    EGL_BUFFER_PRESERVED swap behaviour adds a direct dependency for
    any frame n on frame n - 1 which can affect the pipelining of
    multiple frames but also implies a costly copy-back of data to
    initialize the back-buffer at the start of each frame.

    For example if you consider a double buffered application drawing
    a small spinning icon, but everything else in the scene is static.
    If we know that 2 buffers are continuously being recycled each
    time eglSwapBuffers is called then even though 100s of frames may
    need to be drawn to animate the icon it can be seen that the two
    buffers are remaining unchanged except within the bounds of the
    icon. In this scenario ideally the application would simply
    perform an incremental update of the old buffer instead of
    redundantly redrawing all the static parts of the scene. The
    problem up until now though has been that EGL doesn't report how
    buffers may be recycled so it wasn't safe for applications to try
    and reuse their contents. Now applications can keep track of all
    the regions that have changed over the last n frames and by
    knowing the age of the buffer they know how to efficiently repair
    buffers that are re-cycled instead of redrawing the entire scene.

Additions to Section 3.5 of the EGL 1.4 Specification (Rendering Surfaces)

    Add the following to the table of "Queryable surface attributes
    and types":

      +----------------------+---------+-----------------------------+
      | Attribute            | Type    | Description                 |
      +----------------------+---------+-----------------------------+
      | EGL_BUFFER_AGE_EXT   | Integer | Age of back-buffer contents |
      +----------------------+---------+-----------------------------+
        Table aaa: Queryable surface attributes and types.


    Add the following text to the subsection titled "Surface
    Attributes" in the description for eglQuerySurface

	    Querying EGL_BUFFER_AGE_EXT returns the age of the
	color contents of the current back-buffer as the number of
	frames elapsed since it was defined. For example with a single
	buffered surface the age would usually be 1. With a double
	buffered surface the age would usually be 2. An age of 0 means
	that the contents have only just been initialized and the
	contents are undefined.
	    Once EGL_BUFFER_AGE_EXT has been queried then it can be
	assumed that the age will remain valid until the end of the
	frame such as when eglSwapBuffers is next called.
	    If the returned age is greater than zero then it can be
	assumed that when the buffer contents were created then every
	pixel was owned by the current context and would have passed
	the pixel ownership test.
	    If the EGL driver decides to free un-used back-buffers
	when the system is under memory pressure or in response to
	power-management events then EGL will return an age of 0 when
	it allocates a new buffer at the start of a new frame.
	    Applications can use this age to safely rely on the
	contents of old back-buffers to potentially reduce the amount
	of redrawing they do each frame.
	    If the EGL_BUFFER_PRESERVED swap behaviour is in use then
	it can be assumed that the age will always be 1. It is
	recommended where possible though that the
	EGL_BUFFER_PRESERVED swap behaviour not be used since it can
	have severe performance consequences. Keeping track of the
	buffer age instead and the regions that have changed over the
	last 2 or 3 frames can often replace the need for using
	EGL_BUFFER_PRESERVED without adding a dependency for each
	frame on the previous frame which is what usually make
	EGL_BUFFER_PRESERVED in-efficient.

    Add the following text to last paragraph of the subsection titled
    "Surface Attributes" in the description for eglQuerySurface
    errors.
	
	If querying EGL_BUFFER_AGE_EXT and <surface> is not bound as
	the draw surface to the calling threads current context
	an EGL_BAD_SURFACE error is generated.

Issues

    What are the semantics if EGL_BUFFER_PRESERVED is in use

       RESOLVED: The age will always be 1 in this case. More
       clarification about this was added along with the
       recommendation to use the buffer age to reuse buffers instead
       of EGL_BUFFER_PRESERVED when possible to avoid the
       in-efficiencies of introducing a dependency for each frame on
       the previous frame.

    How can an application know that all pixels of a re-usable buffer
    were originally owned by the current context?

       RESOLVED: the driver must discount any buffer when it is not
       fully owned by the context drawing to it. (If any pixel would
       fail the pixel ownership test.)

       Some drivers may share the back buffer between different
       contexts and so it's possible with overlapping windows that
       some regions of the back buffer aren't owned by the current
       context (they fail the pixel ownership test) which could make
       it difficult for applications to re-use such a buffer later if
       it doesn't know exactly what regions belong to it.

       An alternative to discounting partially owned buffers is that
       we add a way to query the region of owned pixels, but we chose
       to keep the solution simple to ease implementation.

    What are the semantics if the buffer age attribute is queried for
    a surface that isn't bound to the calling thread's context as the
    draw surface?
       
       RESOLVED: we report an EGL_BAD_SURFACE error as is similarly
       done when calling eglSwapBuffers for such a surface.
